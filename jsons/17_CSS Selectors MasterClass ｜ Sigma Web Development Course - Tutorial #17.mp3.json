Now, what kind of elements can we apply style on and how can we select those elements? For example, element with an id, element with a class, we can target the element by its name. And we can also decide that if there is a particular type of element in a particular type of element, then only the styling is applied. I will explain the rules of applying this styling in this video and will explain selectors to you. If you are enjoying this course, then do write Sigma patch OP in the comment section below. We have to maintain high energy throughout the course. I want to give you a heads up that this video is very important. This is a very important video of CSS. So increase your excitement. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so I have come to my computer screen and the first thing I am going to do is to make a folder of video 17. And video 17 is one of the most important videos of CSS. Because if you understand how selectors work, then your work will be very easy. So I will make it here with the name video 17. I will make index.html here. And I am going to use the internal CSS here. I will not make it in the style sheet. So that you can see how I am doing whatever I am doing. And here I will do a lot of things. I will turn on Word Wrap. I will turn on Screencast Mode. So that whatever button I press, you will know. And I will write CSS selectors here. And I will make a div here. And I made a simple div here. I wrote I am a div here. Guys, if you have not accessed it yet, then do play the playlist of Sigma Web Development. And the source code is getting updated. So you should not have any tension in that regard. Now what I am going to do here is a very simple thing. I will preview it first. And I want to make the background of this div red. Now you will say, why do you want to make the background of this div red? Because I want to know how much space this div is taking. That's why I want to make it red. So because I want to make it red, I will simply give the background of this div red. So I will say, I will put a style tag here. I will say that the background of the div should be red. Now this is our property, this is the value. I will tell you about other properties and values. But for now, you understand that this is the property and this is the value. So what I did here was an element selector. So I write here, element selector. And I will comment it here. So in CSS, comments are written like this. Here forward slash, star, and then star. Whatever we write in the middle of forward slash, those are comments in CSS. So I put a CSS comment that this is an element selector. You will see here that the background of this div has turned red. This was our element selector, a very basic selector. Now what are the drawbacks of the element selector that I made here? The drawbacks are that the moment I add another div here, So what will happen, the background of this div will also turn red. And it is possible that you do not want to make the background of this div red. So if you do not want to make the background of this div red, Then what will you do? Definitely you will use some other type of selector here. And you will want to use a specific selector. So I can say that do one thing, Where the class is red, only that div should be red. So I made class is equal to red here. Now because I have made class is equal to red here, You will get to see here, If I write here dot red, And after this, if I make the background color red, Suppose I comment this out, I do not want all the divs to turn red. So I will show you here that only this div will be red. As you can see here. So that's why I used class selector here. So this is our class selector. I will write here class selector. After this, the next selector I am going to tell you is id selector. And you must have guessed it as soon as you heard id selector. Let us say I want the id of the red hashtag, Or let's do one thing, Let's make an id with the name hashtag green. And if I write here background color green, So wherever I will give id green, it will be green. Now you can see here that our I am another div, It has no color, no background color. But as soon as I give it id green, I will show you. I will write here, I will give id to this only. Green, and you can see that I have given background color green in the id name green. Its background color will be green. So this is our id selector. It was very simple, right? Yes, it is simple. We make things simple. Now I will tell you what is child selector. And the source code, This will work for your notes. So what is child selector? If I want the paragraph in a div to turn blue, So I say the color of the paragraph in the div should be blue and what should be the background color? The background color should be brown. Okay, let's say I want this. So if I put a paragraph in any div, I am a para inside div. Okay, so what will happen? This selector will be applied, child selector. Because this is the child of div. This paragraph is the child of div. And I have said that if any paragraph of div is a child, then what will happen? So its background will be brown and blue. As simple as that. Now I will show you one thing. If I wrap this whole thing in a div, understand this carefully. Actually I will span it, not div. I will put it in main or any other element. Let's say I use article tag here. So now this paragraph is not in div. Now this paragraph is in div and in article. So this paragraph is not in div. I will show you. Now this property is not applied. Because this selector means if it is directly in div, then what will happen? This selector will be applied. Here this direct child is not there. In div, there is article and then p. This is not the direct child of div. But if I want that if paragraph is a descendant of any div, then this property is applied. Then what will I do? I have another way. I will simply use descendant selector. What is descendant selector? Descendant selector is something like this. I will write div, space and p. I am saying that p should be in div no matter what it is. Whether it is in div, article, main, footer. It should be in some form. It should be descendant of div. Now you can see that this property is applied. But when I talk about child selector, then child selector should be direct child. I hope you are getting it. Now there is another one, universal selector. It means if I want all elements to have margin 0 and padding 0. If I write p0, then I can write padding 0 It means all elements have margin 0 and padding 0. It was margin and padding which was given by default by Google Chrome. Now this margin and padding is gone. As you saw. I hope you have understood. There are many types of selectors. These are the most used selectors. I will tell you about other selectors in the coming videos. These are the ones with which we will do web development. I don't want to confuse you. I don't want you to learn the main selectors. So I want you to focus on this. This is the most important. 99% of the websites are made with this. I hope you have understood. I hope you have understood. There is one more selector. I will tell you about it. It is pseudo selectors. What is this pseudo selector? Let's say I have a link. I will write it down. I will write it down. Universal selector. Universal selector. Universal selector. What is this? Why is the comment not working? Now I will simply write pseudo pseudo Yes, I know it is pseudo. Don't write in the comment. It is not pneumonia. It is pneumonia. Why is it silent? Tell me in the comment. If it was silent, it would have been like this. Tell me in the comment. I will share my knowledge with you. I will share my knowledge with you. It is pseudo selectors. Let's say I have a link. Let's say I have a link. Let's say I have a link. https://www.google.com https://www.google.com Go to google. Go to google. It is very good. You will go to google and ask what was new in it. I want the color to be yellow. As soon as I visit it. I want a visited to be yellow. to be yellow. I make the color yellow. Will it be yellow? Yes. If I want to see the color yellow after visiting, I can use pseudo selectors. You saw the color changing. You saw the color changing. If you link a colon. If you link a colon. If you want the color to be green. If you want the color to be green. What will be the color? Let's say I go to facebook. Let's capitalize Google's G. Will it be green? No, it won't be green. I have visited Google. I have to type facebook. I will type facebook but it won't be green. What will happen if I type facebook2? I have visited facebook. I have visited facebook. If you remember, in the initial few lectures. That's why it is showing like this. I will tell you about two more links related selectors. One is aactive. If you type any pseudo selector. It will show you the image. If I want the background color to be red. If I click on any link, it will show red. It means when you are clicking. It is showing on google.com. As I click, the background will be red. I know you don't want to use background color red. But that was just an example. To show you how it works. I will make the background color red. Now apart from anchor tag, what else do we have? Some pseudo selectors. One is hover. If I want to hover on anchor tag. And I want the background color to be red. Or the background color to be yellow. I will make the background color yellow. If I hover, you can see the background color is yellow. As I hover. So these were some pseudo selectors. Now I will tell you one more pseudo selector. And that is if I have a div whose class is selector. I will type I am selector. I will put the name 1. ONE1. Now I will tell you about first child pseudo selector. Which will be a little tricky. And this category is pseudo selectors. So this pseudo selector if I type P first child background color aqua. It means wherever P is the first child of the parent. There the background color will be aqua. As you can see in this case I have put a main tag. And here it is written P I am first. And P I am second. So here you can see wherever the first child of the main is P. This P is the first child of the parent. So this class will be applied in this. So you can see that here the background color is aqua. But I will tell you again that these things are very less used when you do web development. So you can do more research about these pseudo classes. I will put the links in the description about these other things. So if you want additional reading material and want to see more pseudo classes then you can find the link in the description. Maybe I will put it in the pinned comment. And if I forget then you can remind me that you have not given the link. So I will give all the links to you. From there you can read about these selectors. But now we will move ahead in this course and will read about the main things. Because we have to come on projects very soon and make good real world apps. And after that we have to do backend and database. So we have to build a little pace here. I hope you are enjoying this course.

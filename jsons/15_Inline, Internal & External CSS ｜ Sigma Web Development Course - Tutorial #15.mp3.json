There are three ways to add CSS to HTML. The first way is inline CSS which is used as a style attribute and added to HTML pages. The second way is internal CSS. Internal CSS means to put a style tag and put the CSS of that HTML in the style tag of the HTML page. And after that, the most used is external CSS. Make a .css file and put all your styles in that .css file. In this video, I will tell you very closely what is the difference between the three, when to use and when to avoid. I am very excited. Do like this video and don't forget to write Sigma patch op in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So I told you three ways to add CSS to any HTML page. The first thing I will do is to make a folder named video15. I will open it by right-clicking and I will make an index.html and put a boilerplate template. If you have not accessed the playlist, then you can access it. It is very important to access the playlist. Now I will come back to my video15 HTML code. Let's say we have a basic HTML. I wrote here I am a good boy. And after that, let's say I put an h1 here and I wrote about me. And here I put in the div I am a good boy. Let's say I put a paragraph too. Everyone is good in some way or the other. Does this even make any sense? Let's say I put this. Here I will click on the view and toggle word wrap. I will not shift right click, I will right click and toggle screencast mode. You listen to me carefully. Look, if I have to style it here, then there is a very short cut method. Which I also call the desi way. I mean, I have a very quick and dirty way. That I will put a style tag here. First of all, let's preview it and see how it looks. So this is how it looks. I have zoomed in to show you, but you will see it like this. Which is fine. But I am showing you by zooming in so that you can see. Now what is written in about, let's say I want to make its background yellow. And I want to make its font red. For some weird reason. Let's do it. So what I have in a very quick and dirty way. That I will put a style attribute here. After this, I will write color here. And I will write yellow here. And you see VS Code is helping me completely. It is fully supporting me in writing. Whatever I am thinking, it is giving me an auto-complete. And that's one of the reasons we are using VS Code. If you go to any website or any IDE, then you get this kind of support. This is the reason we don't code in notepad. In the beginning, many people asked me questions. Why don't we do it in notepad? What is there in this that is not in notepad? So this is fine. Now let's say I want to add another property. First I will show that this property has been applied. You see its color has become yellow. Now let's say I want to make its background red. Background color red. Fine. And here the background will also turn red. Whatever I want to do with the help of CSS, I can do it. I want to add individual elements to those things. So I can do that. Now this is not considered a good practice. It is not considered a good practice. Why it is not considered? I will tell you in a while. But I will tell you two more ways. Adding CSS to a webpage. I do one thing. I do one thing. I will write the title of this. Three ways to add CSS to HTML. Fine. So our first way which I have written. I do one thing. I use div here. I will use ordered list. I will use OL. Fine. And I will write a list item. And I am going to write here. The first way is inline CSS. Fine. So I told you about inline CSS. This is called inline CSS. That by holding any element, What will happen to writing CSS in style attribute? That CSS will be applied in that element. This will happen. So till now we have read about inline CSS. First way. Now I will tell you the second way. Here I will write li. The second way is internal CSS. Fine. So the second way is that you don't do like this. Fine. I will replicate this. And I will remove this style attribute. You will say don't do like this. Write a style tag. Fine. Listen carefully. Don't get confused. Listen to me very carefully. Put a style tag here in the head after the title. Here. And your selector and declaration. Write everything here. Fine. So what is our selector? H1. I will say that all the H1 of this page. What to do? Background it yellow. And color it red. Fine. I think I did color yellow first. So I color yellow background red. Fine. Color it yellow. Background it red. That's it. I made the color yellow. Background it red. It will be the same as before. But how is this different from inline CSS? Inline CSS, I have to add style to every element. You understand. If there is 100 H1 on my page. Then I can do this automatically. But here I have to do style is equal to Style is equal to Style is equal to Style is equal to Again and again. So I don't want to do it again and again. Okay, let's say I did it again and again. I put style is equal to in every element. Now let's say I have to change. For some reason, my boss told me. That in our production website, Background color is not red. Background color has to be marooned. So what will I do? Will I maroon all the elements one by one? Instead of red? No. I want to bulk edit. And if I am using internal CSS. And not using inline CSS. Then I can bulk edit. What do I have to do? Instead of red, I have to maroon one place. And all the H1 of my page will be marooned. But if I have written like this in every element individually. Style is equal to Style is equal to Style is equal to So first of all, I have to find all those elements. After that, I will have to do it individually in all of them. So that's why inline CSS is not used as much. But you should know what inline CSS is. Why is it? How can you use it? You will do internal. Or the most used one. External CSS. I will tell you about it. Now the idea of external CSS is that If you are writing internal CSS. Then your style tag will keep growing. Suppose I am writing CSS here. I am writing, I am writing. So your HTML file will keep growing. Will keep doing. Will keep doing. So why don't we write the CSS here. Why don't we write that CSS in a file? This is the idea of external CSS. Whatever you are writing here. Don't write here. You write in a file. So we will use a link tag. If I write colon CSS. Then this shortcut will come here. So I am saying that I have written my CSS in style.css. What have I done? I have written my CSS in style.css. Go and see there. Okay. I have done something like this. Okay. So here I show you. That I can write style.css like this. And as soon as I write style.css here. And I will put these styles in it. Now I show you that Styles have been removed from my page. By the way. The background is not red. Nothing is yellow. But as soon as I add here. So this style.css. I have linked it here. So what does link tag do? Link says that As a style sheet link style.css. So what will happen? This CSS will be added to my page. It's as simple as that. Okay. I hope you have understood all this. And you guys have understood this thing very clearly. That inline CSS. Internal CSS. And what is the difference in external CSS? Now I tell you guys. When you have to use which one? See guys. You guys don't try to use inline CSS at all. Okay. I am saying. Try not to use inline CSS in ideal scenarios. But if inline CSS is automatically generated. About which I will tell you guys later. Now don't be confused. Now as a beginner. You understand this. That you have to use inline CSS at least. In fact, you have to avoid it. Okay. You will use internal CSS. When your web page is very small. And you just have to write CSS very lightly. Like I tell you a very good use case. To use internal CSS. When I used to write websites in bootstrap. Then in my website. All the styling was done by bootstrap. But sometimes I had to do light tweaks. Then I used internal CSS. External CSS you will use. When you are making a big production grade website. And in most of the cases. If you are working on a serious project. You must be making a production grade website. And if you are making a production grade website. Then you will want to use best practices in it. And using external style sheet. Is considered a good practice. Why? Because you can detach a style sheet from an HTML. You can also attach. You can tell your colleagues. You work on a style sheet. I work on HTML. You write styles. I am working on HTML. So you can work very well parallelly. These things become very easy. If you use external style sheet. And in most of the cases. In any kind of production grade project. You go to big websites. Whether it is Netflix or YouTube. Or it is Quora. Or it is Facebook or Instagram. WhatsApp, web or anything. In most of the cases. In all these websites. You will get external style sheets. So I will make you do a revision. Inline CSS means. You have to put a style tag in the element. And write CSS. Internal CSS means. You have to put a style tag and write CSS. And external CSS means. You have to make a style.css. Or any name.css file. And link it to a CSS file. I hope you have understood the difference between these three. And I know I am going a little slower. Because many people are beginners in this course. I am telling you again. We are going to raise the bar like anything. We are going to make very dangerous. Production grade websites. In the coming videos. So you guys will be excited. Do tell me in the comment section below. Now if you have not accessed this playlist. Then do access it. I will update everything in the source code. Don't worry about it. That's all for this video for now. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Outro Music."}

Along with that, I will tell you about anchor text. If you have found this course awesome till now, then do like this video. Your likes will help me in bringing such free courses. In this video, we will make a small project which will be a bookmark website. This bookmark website will help you to bring all your favorite websites in one place. And you will be able to use it in actual. So let's start quickly. Write down in the comment quickly, Sigma Batch OP. Let's roll the intro. Intro So guys, as you can see, I have come inside my computer screen. And if you have not accessed the playlist yet, then you can access it. One more thing I want to tell you is that if you go to GitHub.com slash code with Ari, you will get the GitHub repo of the Sigma Web Dev course. Now I have made folders for all the videos in it. And the commit is also made according to different folders. So you will get it. So you must access it so that you get the source code. I will also put the source code of the video in the description. So there is nothing to worry about. Now we will make a very basic website today. But it will be very important for us because it will be our first useful website. So without taking much time, I will make a new folder in this folder of Sigma Web Dev. And I will name it video 4 because it is our fourth video. So I will make it with the name video 4. I will click on Open with Code by right-clicking on the shift key. So that this folder opens in our VS Code. After doing this, I will do the same thing that we have always done. index.html, main.css, style.css and script.js We usually make these three files. If I write CSS, I will put it here. If I write script, I will put it here. But for now, I will write an exclamation mark here and write it in the document. My bookmarks. Okay, so we are going to make a bookmark website. And I will write code with Ari here. So you must have seen such titles. Now I will write h1 here. Now what happens with h1? You can put a heading from h1 on your web page. We talked about the basic structure. We said that this tells that this is an HTML page. HTML lang is equal to en. Lang is an attribute and its value is en. This means that the content of this page is in English. This tells the search engines. Or if anyone is sitting with the link of this web page, then he will know that this web page is in English. Accordingly, he can parse this web page. The browser will also know that your web page is in English. Now here is the head in which metadata is there. Which title of the page is there. Which CSS is linked. All these things are information. The main content is inside the body. Now there is a tag inside the body to put a heading. Its name is h1. And I am going to write my bookmarks on it. So if I write my bookmarks here, then we will write it with h1 tag. And if I want to do it live here. I will click here and after that I will do it. Open in browser. Now you can see my bookmarks. Now why should we always use h1? Why didn't I write my bookmark directly? Because I am telling the browser that this is my heading and this is my first level heading. Now suppose I want to keep two types of bookmarks in my bookmarks. One main bookmark and one secondary bookmark. So I will use h2. That is, the second level heading. If you have used Microsoft Word, then you will know what h1 and h2 are. But if you don't know, then I will tell you. H1 is your main level heading. And after that the second level heading is from h2. Suppose I say main bookmarks and secondary bookmarks. Suppose I do something like this. And here I will press Alt, Shift and Down Arrow. I will do one thing. Why don't I turn on screencast mode? So what I did here is Alt, Shift and Down Arrow. So this is replicated. This is a shortcut of VS Code. I would like to tell you one more shortcut of VS Code. If you press Alt on your keyboard, then wherever you click, a cursor will be created. Suppose I click here, then only one cursor will come. But if I press Alt and click somewhere else, then the cursor will keep coming. Suppose I want to do all bookmarks with bookmarks code. So my bookmarks dash code with Harry. I can write something like this. How did I do this? I clicked here, then I pressed Alt, and wherever I press Alt and click, I will get multiple cursors there. Then whatever I type, it will come in multiple cursors. Wherever there are cursors, whatever I type there, it will be visible. Isn't it fun? Like it. I will remove it like this. And you will see that it will be updated. So this is my main heading, this is my H2. Similarly, from H1 to H2, we have heading up to H6. Suppose you gave a main heading. After the main heading, you gave a secondary heading. Then after that, you had to give some heading inside it. And so on. You had to give a lot of subheadings. Then you can give a heading up to H6. H6 is more than enough. In HTML, there are headings up to H6. You will never need H7. If we talk about practical life. You can use H6 repeatedly. Because it becomes so small after H1. That H6 will become very small. You don't want it to be so small. Now what I will do here, I will replicate it with Alt Shift Down Arrow. And I will click here, I will press Alt. I am telling you all these shortcuts so that your productivity increases. Now I have put two cursors here and here. I will press backspace and make it H3. Then I will click here, I will press Alt. I will click here, I will make it H4. And I will click here, I will click here, I will make it H5. Then I will click here, I will click here, I will make it H6. So it is up to H6. Now what I will do, I will write here using H1 so that you know. I will write using here. I will press space, I will write using, I will write H. And now my work is left. I will click here and write 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. And you see, it is looking like this. So you know that H1 is like this, H2 is like this. H3 is so small, H4 is so small, H5 is so small. H6 is so small. And what will happen if it is smaller than H6? It will end at some point. So H6 is more than enough. So I will show you a practical demonstration of this. For example, this is my HTML tutorial. So here I have given the main heading, HTML introduction. After this, I have given here, what is HTML. Then I have given features of HTML. I gave this from H1, I gave this from H2. Then I gave something from H3. I gave something from H3. Like here, why the term hypertext and markup language was there. This is heading 2. What is the main heading page? HTML introduction. After this, all these are heading. I had to give a quick exercise in this also. So I used H3 in that also. Then I came back to H2. Because it was in this. So in building the hierarchy, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 are used. I hope you all understood. Many people are commenting that you are starting very slow. That's why we know. I am making this course as a beginner course. When I tell you HTML, then you will say that it is very easy. Then I will tell you a little CSL. Then I will tell you JavaScript. Then I will tell you Bootstrap. Then you will say that it will be done. Then I will tell you React. Then you will say what is happening. Then suppose Node.js. Then I will take things to MongoDB MySQL. Then after that, the level will go up so much. I said that we will raise the bar like anything. This is what I meant. So when we will do React. When I will make projects there. When I will do dangerous things. Then I will ask them to comment. Tell me what is the level. Don't talk about the level. The level is going to rise. So these are our 6 headings. If we want to write a paragraph. Then you can use the P tag. If you type P, this paragraph will come. Now I will tell you a shortcut trick. If you want to bring a dummy paragraph in VS Code through Emmet, then what will you do? You will write lorem here. Suppose I wrote lorem 23. Now see Emmet abbreviation has come. It is of lorem 23. It will give me 23 words. Something like this. You can click on view and wrap the word. Then you will not get a horizontal scroll bar. So you can wrap the word view. Now see here. Lorem, Epsom, Dollar, Set. Here is a dummy text. Why do we want dummy text sometimes? Because we want it because we are making a template. And we have to fill that template with something. Like suppose you are making a website which looks like OYO rooms. Now here OYO, Become a Member, OYO for Business. I don't have to write all this here. I just wrote lorem here. Now I have to write something here. So I will write lorem here. I will write lorem 7 and enter. Then I will give it to OYO people. They will do whatever they want to write. You use it to fill the placeholder. My plan is that we will also make popular website clones so that you will know how things work. This is also a very popular website. If you have used their services, then do tell us in the comment section below. Now we will see other things like here there is a paragraph. How do you have to style it? And all these things are done through CSS. Now in the paragraph, you see here when I wrote lorem 23, so much text came. Now I will hit p enter here. If I write lorem 10 here, then only 10 words will come. And if I want to write lorem 100, my page will be too full. So I can do that too. So this lorem trick is very good. You will enjoy it. And whenever we make a clone of popular websites, let's say I make a clone of amazon.in. I make a clone of amazon.in. So let's say I have to write something here. Now I can't see so much text here. Let's say I have to write 3 words here. So I will write lorem 3. I will not think about makeup products. I will write lorem 4 here, lorem 3 here, lorem 2 here and make a template and get it ready. Then whatever is there after that, it will also come in my database and I can bring my text in a very different way. Many people asked if this course will be job ready. The answer is yes, this course is going to be job ready. Absolutely, I will make you so that you will be able to do actual industry level jobs through the learning of this course. Now let's talk about what are the attributes in HTML. These are the attributes in HTML. Like I used the HTML tag. Lang is equal to in. Lang is an attribute. We did not use any attribute in the body. We did not use any attribute in H1. We did not use any attribute in P. But I can use a style attribute in P which is also called inline CSS. If I make the background color red here, okay, like this, then the background color will be red. This is also called inline CSS through style attribute. So if you put style is equal to CSS, first we learned to put CSS here, but if you put style is equal to, then you will get this background red here. Let me show you, you got this red background. Okay, I will make it teal or this, this color is looking good, so I can also put style inline. But when you make industry level websites, we use inline styles very little because usability reduces, reusability reduces. Okay, so we want to ship a small bundle on the browser and our website is more and more optimized. That's why we avoid all these things. But inline CSS has a style tag, but here style is an attribute. P is a tag. P tag has an attribute style through which we can style this element. We will also learn about many other attributes. Attributes basically give an element enhanced functionality. Like this paragraph, we gave a style which was background color this background color, we used style attribute. Similarly, to give properties to any tag, to any element, we use these attributes. Like if we talk about link, link colon CSS, link has relic attribute, href attribute. So what we can do with this attribute, we can put this CSS style sheet. Like let's say background, background background color, I will put body here first. What we need in body, background color. And you don't worry about it. Because in CSS, all this will be told. But I am just telling you that I will make it hot pink. Listen to another functionality of VS code. This ninja technique will be very useful. Here hover the mouse and here in this way you can choose any color you want. Like this I leave it and do this. So you see here, the background color is this. How did you like ninja technique? Write in the comment. Now here we have come back to index.html. I can remove it if I want. I will comment it out. So this style sheet will not be there. Which is very natural. The background color was coming from this style sheet. This background color was coming from inline CSS. So it didn't remove it. Which is very natural. It is very normal. Here I did this style is equal to background color because of which its background color was visible. Now we are going to make a bookmark manager. bookmarkmanager.html I am making it a different file because here I have told you different types of headings. I am going to make a useful bookmark manager. I will write here bookmark manager. Now you will say that in chrome why are you making bookmark manager? This is made by our hands. This will be our child. We have made it. So you will have a different pream for it. Because you have made it yourself. Someone made a software. You bought it from somewhere. You made a software yourself. So the software you made yourself is different. Now here you can see bookmark manager code is written. I will write h1 and I will write my bookmarks. I wrote my bookmarks. Now I will write h2. I will write primary bookmarks. And after this I will write secondary bookmarks from h2. In fact, if I do alt shift bottom space and I write here secondary bookmarks. So what will happen? Here I can put secondary bookmarks. Now what I will do is I will write google in a paragraph. Here I will write like this. We will write it from list. But in the coming videos I will tell you how to use list. For now, you understand like this. Google. Suppose I write google here. And what I will do here? I will use anchor tag. So as soon as I hit enter in a, a has a mandatory attribute. href means by clicking it which link it should go to. So I will write href https://www.google.com It will go to this address whenever someone clicks on open google. And this open google I will cut it and put it here. That is, the content of the stack will be like this. And here you can see href is equal to this. Open google has come. This is called anchor tag which helps us to make links. You must have seen a lot of links like this. Now you see here that as soon as I go to bookmark manager .html, you can see here that you can see all the bookmarks like this. Open google. Now if I click on it, google will open. You can see. Now you noticed one thing. When I did not click on it then its color was blue. Now I visited it so its color has changed. So its color changes when you visit it. That is, it has been converted into a visited link. So I know that I have visited it. Now I tell you one more thing. Here if we want it to open in a new tab. Like I am clicking on it, it is opening in the same tab. If you want to open it in a new tab, then you have two ways. Either you can click on the wheel of your mouse like this. You can click on it like this. Now I tell you another way that if you want someone to click on it and open it in a new tab, then you can use an attribute. You can write here that target is equal to underscore blank. And VS code gives you suggestions. So I wrote it by hitting two enters. If you write in notepad or in any other cheap editor, then what happens to you? Means cheap in terms of quality. Free is also VS code. But if you use a cheap editor, then target is equal to underscore blank. You will have to type it all. It is a little painful. But if you write it in any way, what will happen now? Now I will click on it. I am clicking. I am not clicking the mouse wheel. I am clicking. I will click. It came to the new tab. Okay. If I click on the mouse wheel, it will still open in the new tab. So this way I can open it. Now I have written a very simple open google here. If you want then your favorite website, whichever website is your favorite, you can put it here. Okay. Good websites have been put, friends. Okay. Here I will write open facebook and here you see www.facebook.com and let's say I write here quora.com and codewithhari.com and after this we put here let us say which website should I put? youtube.com Let's see if it came here or not. You have seen one thing here. It is coming in the same line. Okay. If you want it not to come in one line, then what will you do? You will put them in your paragraphs. This is a very dirty way. Why I am saying dirty way, I will tell you later. But you can enclose it in a paragraph if you want and I will press shift and right arrow key, I will press ctrl x, then after this I will press end key. All the cursors will go to the end because if you press end key on one cursor, then they go to the end. And after this I will also press ctrl v. Now I have used this shortcut a lot and many of you will be like this. What did you do if you are a beginner? But what I simply did is used the functionality of VS Code. Multiple cursor functionality. I have brought multiple cursors and then I used it. Ideally, this is not a good way. We never make a list by using paragraphs. We make lists by using them but because we have not read the list, then we are using paragraphs. But this will work for us. It will look like this. And those which we have not visited are blue. If we visit Facebook, its color also becomes purple. If we visit Quora, its color also becomes purple. So now these are your primary bookmarks. What will be your secondary bookmarks? We put two secondary bookmarks. Suppose your secondary bookmarks are those which you visit sometimes. Follow wikipedia.com. And suppose stackoverflow.com. We will write the spelling correctly. Stackoverflow. Let's capitalize Stackoverflow. And now you see here in secondary bookmarks your wikipedia and stackoverflow have come. So this has become your bookmark manager. And you can make this bookmark manager even better. We will learn styling from CSS. So if you see this ugly, then don't take tension. Don't say that this is very ugly. Don't take tension at all because we will do styling in the coming time. We will talk about all those things. For now, your bookmark looks like this. Bookmark manager code with area is your title. And I also write it in H1. So both will be the same. Our title and H1. That is, our title will also be the same. My bookmarks code with area will also be written here. So this way you can make a bookmark manager. You can actually use it. Now if you save it like this, like my bookmarkmanager.html. You can copy this and put it on your desktop if you want. Then whenever you want to open a website, you just double click it and it will open. If you double click it and it opens with VS code, then what you have to do is right click, open with, choose another app and then here you have to choose Google Chrome and always. So I will choose Google Chrome and I will always do it. So whenever I double click, it will open with Google Chrome. So this was our bookmark manager. I hope you liked it. Now I have a request from you that today our four videos are complete. So if you liked this course, I want you to share it with your friends in groups. I know very few people will share it, but if you do it, then it gives me a lot of courage and I will try to bring more courses like this. Many people are shocked and saying that how is this course free? What is the benefit of you? How will you earn? I will find some other ways to make more money. But the thing is that I am going to mark this course like this that this is the best course of web development with everything. I mean I will put everything in it and I will take as little time as possible and teach you as much as possible. Many edtechs got upset with me. Many companies told me that they launch paid courses on our platform. I will not take names, but many companies are upset with me and they told me that let's launch it as a paid course. Why are you doing this? You will regret your decision. But hopefully I will not regret my decision to make this course free. I will earn money in other ways and I will also teach you in this course that through web development, how can you earn more money? With that said, I will put it in the description. Its source code, otherwise you can take it from this repository. That's all for now in this video. Thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time."}

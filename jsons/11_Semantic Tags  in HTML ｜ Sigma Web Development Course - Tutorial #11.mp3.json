We have completed 10 videos. So one like is enough for the consistency of all of us. In today's video, we will see about Semantic Tags. Because they are very important for SEO. And to understand the structure of the overall website, search engines are very happy to see this structure. That means overall SEO of your website is going to be very good if you use these tags. What are these tags? Why are these tags? How to use them? What are the benefits? We will see in this video. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro So guys, I would like to tell you what are Semantic Tags? Here you can see that I have made a folder named Video 11. And here I have set the title by putting a boilerplate template of index.html. By putting an H1, I am going to set this image and preview it here. So this is the image. To explain a little, I will tell you what are Semantic Tags? Semantic Tags are for browsers and web crawlers who want to understand your website properly. They tell them what is the content of your website? And what is the purpose of which place and which tag? If you don't use Semantic Tags in HTML, then your work will be done. It's not like if you don't use Semantic Tags, then your website won't look good. You can do a good design. But we want to explain to Google and Bing search engines about our website. And if we explain them about our website, then they will be able to understand our website. And they will rank our website on Google, Bing, respective search engines. And we want the crawlers to understand our website. And we want whoever wants to understand our website to understand it well. That's why there are some special tags. Like header, nav, main, article, figure. All these are special tags in HTML which help in structuring your website. Now if there is something in the header, then I know that it is the header. That is, it is at the top. If there is something in the footer, then I will understand that the website has started ending from here. This footer has started here. This footer could also be div. But no, if I am using Semantic HTML, then I will use the footer tag. Along with that, where I was making my navigation bar in the span tag, this time I will not make my navigation bar in the span tag. I will make my navigation bar in the nav tag. So these kinds of differences explain our search engines very well about what our website is about. So I will show you some examples of semantic tags here. And I hope you understood what semantic tags are. Now see, there are download folders like our computer. Many of you must have a download folder that you have got all the files of the world in it. 90% of the files of your computer are in the download folder of many people. But we should not do this. Some people go to such an extent that they start spreading files in their local disk C, in the windows folder. And some people keep files in system 32 too, friends. So if you spread your files in your entire computer, then definitely it is not arranged in one way. But if you arrange it in folders, that you have this file in one folder. If you want to put a secret file in a folder, you put secret files. You can make a folder called do not open disk. If you can put some of your files in it, then it will be arranged in one way. You have arranged images in one way, you have arranged videos in one way, and you have arranged letters in one way, and you have arranged e-books in one way. So whenever you go to find it, you will get it. So it will be much better for you to understand that folder structure instead of if you are spreading your files throughout the computer. You definitely don't want to spread your files throughout the computer. So I hope you understood why we use semantic tags. It is very good for our SEO. So SEO is a word, I have not used it yet. But SEO is a very important part of search engine optimization. Using semantic tags. So what happens? Basically, I make your website the way you make it. You just use some special tags. For example, let's say I am making this website. What I will do now is I will comment this image here. What are semantic tags? I will not comment this. What I will do here is I will make a navbar. So what I will do? First of all, I will say that this is the header of my website. I have used a header tag. I will make a nav in it. In this, I will make an unordered list. I will make an li in it. And I will write home here. And after that, let's say I am writing a lot like this. And this is my header like this. So anyone who comes to my website will understand that this is my header. Home, about, contact, whatever I want to write, I can write here. So this is my header, this is my navbar. This is clearly visible because I have used header and nav tags. So I write about here. And I write contact here. So I wrote home here, I wrote about here, and I wrote contact here. So I hope you understood this thing. Now if I want a footer, let's say I want to make a footer. Here my main content will come after the header. So I will use the main tag. And after that, my footer, let's say I write in the footer. Copyright, CWH, and here I write all rights reserved. Okay, I can write like this. So here, look, copyright, all rights reserved, I wrote all this here. Did I, uh, this, yes. So what I will do is I will cut this. I will put this in the main. This is my main content. So first my header will come, then the main content will come, then the footer will come. As you can see here. And here too, you see, here is the header, this is my main content, this is the footer. So in one way, what I did is I arranged it. In the same way, the way you arrange your files in different folders. I have arranged my HTML tags here. So we understood about the header tag that it is used to represent the top section of a web page. Which is the header. Then after that, we put nav, which is the navigation menu on our page, in the nav tag. Ideally, the article indicates a self-containing piece of content such as a blog post or news article. If you put a particular self-contained piece of content, then put it in the article tag. Section represents a thematic grouping. That is, suppose one section is talking about one thing on your page. Then the second section will talk about something else. Aside, aside means if anything is lying on the side, then it is used as an aside tag. So here you see, typically used for sidebars or content that is tangentially related to the main content. Like what you can do on the aside tag. That you have to put a side note, you have to put about the author. You must have seen a lot of blogs in which the side is also written about the author. So you can put such things in the aside tag. Then after this we have the footer tag. I told you about this. If you want to put copyright information or if you want to put some important links of the website, then you can put it in the footer. Then after this, figure and fig caption. What is figure and fig caption? Whenever you want to use images, diagrams, charts, etc., then you can use figure and fig caption. The main content area inside the main, like the main content area of \u200b\u200bour page was this. We put it in the main tag. Then there is also a time tag. Used to represent time-related information. So you can use the time tag. You can put date, time or anything in it. So I hope you understand this thing now. So these are used to enhance SEO. Accessibility is used to improve. And if browsers want to make a decision about any of our pages. For example, a browser has a new feature that it will read our content aloud. Like Edge has a feature. So the browser can decide that I am only reading the main content aloud. Now think about it, if someone wants to read this page aloud, then how will he read it aloud? Code with Harry, Home, Courses, Tutorial. You don't want to be allowed to read like this. You want the main content to be read. HTML, Semantic Tags. HTML5 Introduce, Arrange, Semantic Tags. The first versions of our HTML did not have semantic tags. Semantic tags were introduced from HTML5. And the most important reason to introduce semantic tags in HTML5 is to arrange things. So that the browser or whoever is parsing the content. Whoever is looking at the code of our content. Whether it is a browser, crawler, google, bing, search engines. Or if anyone wants to generate a preview. Like if you put a URL on Twitter, then it wants to generate a preview. If there are such things. You will want your content to be understood properly. So if you want your content to be understood properly. Then you will use semantic tags. Here this image is explaining very well. That without semantic tags, if you write HTML like this. Then you will write semantic tags like this. This image you are seeing. This is a header, this is a nav, this is a side. How to throw one thing in the side. We will do all this with CSS. Don't be confused. This is not used for styling. Because many people are confused. It is not used to assign things. No, it is not at all. You will have to style things with CSS. But here your content can be understood properly. Can be described. Which is the main content, which is the header or footer. That's why semantic tags are made. So semantic tags do not do any magic. Semantic tags are made. Only for accessibility. And to understand your page. Now there are some examples here. I have given the example of header and footer tag. What will happen inside the header. You will put your navigation bar inside the header. And then style it with CSS. I will show you a very quick styling. Obviously we will talk about styling later. But many people must be confused. How will this navigation bar be horizontal. So if you want to make the navigation bar horizontal. I will write some CSS here. And I will tell you all this. Why does CSS work here. So you see I have flexed the display. So it happened like this. So a lot is going to happen in the coming videos. So don't worry at all. I will tell you everything. And what does this CSS mean here. Why did I inspect and write CSS. I will tell you about this too. I will reload it. Why did it go. We will see all this in the CSS section. If you have not accessed this playlist yet. Then do it. Click here and save it. And I am uploading all the code. So as you move forward in the videos. You will get all the code here video wise. Do start this repository. And like the video too. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time."}

I'd be happy to help you with your Sigma web development course.

To answer your question, "what is a vs code and which place", let me see... 

In Video 1 of our course, we talk about installing VS Code and how websites work. Specifically, in the first part of the video (around 148 seconds into the tutorial), we discuss what VS Code is. Unfortunately, I can only tell you that much because that's where the explanation starts.

The instructor explains that it's an integrated development environment (IDE) for web developers, which means it provides a set of tools to help us build, write, and debug our web applications. 

If you'd like to know more about how websites work or other topics covered in this video, I can guide you through Video 1.

However, if your question is not related to our course content, I'm afraid I won't be able to assist you further. Our courses are designed to teach specific web development skills and concepts, so please make sure to ask questions that relate to those topics.
